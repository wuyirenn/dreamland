                        Real talk: I'm procrastinating the f*ck out of this particular project. I started earlier this summer, but life's been 
                        busy, and I'm having trouble both finding inspiration and motivation. Please check back in soon! Promise it won't be long! {"<"}3

                        I am quite proud of the progress so far though. This site takes inspiration from Minh Pham and Fernando Pinto, designed loosely with pen and paper, 
                        coded in VS Code, prototyped in Figma, and built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

                        The background composite is one of many Photoshop composites I've made over the years (using Unsplash, Adobe Stock, and my own photos). 
                        Inspired by the old Alto's Odyssey iPhone game, it embodies freedom and contains my love for desert scenery. Lastly, the music was 
                        composed by Tim @ Tabletop Audio. His music speaks for itself -- it's beautiful.
