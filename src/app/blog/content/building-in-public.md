# Building in Public

Building in public means sharing your work as it happens. It's about being transparent with your process and learning in the open.

## Why build in public?

1. **Accountability** - When you share your progress, you're more likely to stick to your commitments
2. **Feedback** - Getting early feedback helps you iterate and improve faster
3. **Community** - You connect with others who are on similar journeys

## The Process

Here's what I've learned about building in public:

- Share early and often
- Don't wait for perfection
- Document your failures as well as successes
- Engage with feedback constructively

## Final Thoughts

Building in public isn't just about showing your workâ€”it's about creating a dialogue with your audience and learning together.
